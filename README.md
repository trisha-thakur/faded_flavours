# Faded Flavours 🍛

## Problem Statement 👩‍🍳

In today's fast-paced world, traditional and authentic recipes are getting lost, and people are increasingly turning towards fast food. To preserve the cultural heritage of food and promote healthy eating habits, there is a need for a platform that can store and share lost recipes. The lack of such a platform has resulted in a significant loss of culinary knowledge, and there is an urgent need to address this issue. The challenge is to create a user-friendly platform that can collect, store, and share traditional recipes from around the world, ensuring that they are accessible to future generations.

## Solution 🍳

The Lost Recipes Repository is a platform designed to store and share traditional recipes from around the world. The platform is user-friendly and provides an easy way for users to access lost recipes. Users can search for recipes based on various criteria, such as country, ingredients, or type of cuisine. The platform allows users to contribute their own recipes, ensuring that the repository is always growing. For now, I have initially built this platform oriented towards Indian cuisine but we aim to expand it to other cuisines as well.
